# Personal Site

This is a full stack personal site that I built to showcase my skills and projects.

It contains an informational page, a blog, and my portfolio.

It is written in TypeScript on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. MongoDB is used for the blog database, and Framer Motion is used for the animations.
